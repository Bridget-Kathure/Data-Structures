# Heap Data Structure

HEAPS 

A heap is a data structure that is a complete binary tree and satisfies the heap property.

TYPES OF HEAPS
1. max-heap
   Parent node in Max-heap tree has a larger value than its children nodes.

2. min-heap
   Parent node in min-heap tree has a value smaller than its children nodes.

ADVANTAGES OF HEAPS
1. Requires less memory compared to other data structure
2. Stores elements in a complete binary tree structure.
3. Guaranteed access to min/max elements.
4. Fast insertion and deletion of elements.
5. Fast access to highest-priority elements.

DISADVANTAGES OF HEAPS
1. Cannot search for a specific element in a heap.
2. Managing memory allocated for the heap can be a challenge.
3. Order of equal elements may not be preserved when constructing a heap.
4. It is not flexible because it is designed to maintain a certain order of elements.

APPLICATION OF BINARY TREES
1. Can be used to implement sorting algorithms.
2. Used to store data in a database.
3. Used to search for specific elements in binary search algorithms.
4. Used to implement file systems.
